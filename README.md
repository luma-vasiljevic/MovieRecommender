# MovieRecommender

This is code for shiny apps for movie recommender systems.

App1: [CrudeMoveRecommender](https://luma.shinyapps.io/CrudeMovieRecommender/) recommends most popular movies in a selected genre
uses ui_system1.R, server_system1.R (save as ui.R, server.R if you wish to run)

App2: [MovieRecommender](https://luma.shinyapps.io/MovieRecommender/) recommends a movie based on user based collaborative filtering (see Report.html)
uses ui_system2.R, server_system2.R (save as ui.R, server.R if you wish to run)

App2 is a copy cat of this [app](https://philippsp.shinyapps.io/BookRecommendation/), See read me in this [repo](https://github.com/pspachtholz/BookRecommender)
