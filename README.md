# MovieRecommender

This is code for shiny apps for movie recommender systems.

App1: [CrudeMoveRecommender](https://luma.shinyapps.io/CrudeMovieRecommender/) recommends most popular movies in a selected genre

App2: [MovieRecommender](https://luma.shinyapps.io/MovieRecommender/) recommends a movie based on user based collaborative filtering (see Report.html)

App2 is a copy cat of this [app](https://philippsp.shinyapps.io/BookRecommendation/), See read me in this [repo](https://github.com/pspachtholz/BookRecommender)

Thank you [pspachtholz](https://github.com/pspachtholz) for sharing your code
